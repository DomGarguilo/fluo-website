Fluo 1.0.0-beta-1 is the second official release of Fluo.  The release closed [122 tickets][tickets].  This release is not recommended for production use.

## Significant features

This release contains many new features that makes it easier to run, develop, and monitor Fluo applications.

#### Simplified Fluo administration on a local machine or EC2 cluster

Developers can now run Fluo and its dependencies on their local machine ([#92][92]) or an AWS EC2 cluster ([#356][356]) using a few simple commands.
This was done by creating to admistration tools called [Fluo-dev][fluo-dev] and [Fluo-deploy][fluo-deploy] whose scripts and configuration reside in repos
separate from the Fluo code base.  These tools allow developers to collaborate and share configuration for running Fluo.

#### Transaction metrics are viewable using common monitoring tools

Fluo now publishes metrics ([#20][20]) about transactions, collisions, and timestamps using [Dropwizard metrics][dropwizard].  These metrics are by default published 
using JMX and are viewable using JConsole or JVisualVM.  Fluo can also be configured to publish metrics to Graphite or Ganglia.  View the [metrics documentation][metrics]
for more information.

#### Improved processing of notifications in Fluo workers

Fluo workers were refactored to seperate the code used for finding and executing work.  Each worker uses a single thread for finding 
work ([#19][19]).  A new method was introduced to partition work among workers using a hash+mod of notifications ([#282][282]).

#### Easier management of Fluo from the command line

Fluo now provides different scripts (**fluo**, **mini-fluo**, & **local-fluo**) for managing Fluo using a YARN cluster, MiniFluo, or local processes.  Several commands
were created for these scripts.  A **scan** command allows users to print a snapshot of a Fluo table ([#319][319]).  A **info** command shows locations of containers
when running Fluo in YARN ([#297][297]).  A **classpath** command gives users a list of jars needed to execute Fluo client code ([#436][436]).  A **wait** command will
sleep until all notifications are processed ([#434][434]).

#### Support for running multiple Fluo applications on a single cluster

Users can now run multiple Fluo applications using a single cluster ([#454][454]).  This enables different Fluo users to share the same cluster.  Fluo applications
can be brought up and down without affecting the other.

#### Fluo testing improvements

Integration tests can now be run from Eclipse ([#322][322]).  Several new [unit tests][unit] were created.

#### Impoved the deletion of observer notifications

Notification deletion was moved to end of a transaction to fix incorrect counts that occured when Fluo was restarted in the middle of a stress test ([#456][456]).

#### Fluo build improvements

On each build, all Java code is automatically formatted based on Google Java Style ([#479][479]).  Also, checkstyle and findbugs will fail the build if certain
standards are not reached ([#185][185]).  The POM is also sorted ([#493][493]).

#### Organized Fluo code base

The Fluo stress test was moved to its own [repo][fluo-stress] and is no longer a sub-module ([#385][385]).  MiniFluo was moved from fluo-core to the fluo-mini 
module/jar ([#439][439]).  This reduced the number of dependencies in fluo-core.  However, developers will now need to include the fluo-mini jar in their Maven
POM if they start MiniFluo.

#### Other important improvements and bug fixes

* [#460][460] - Reduced Fluo API module dependencies
* [#446][446] - Simplified log configuration and configure rolling log files in YARN
* [#442][442] - Reduced the number of curator clients in FluoAdmin
* [#383][383] - Improved transaction logging to help users debug collisions
* [#365][365] - Analyze Fluo code to see what non-public Accumulo APIs are used
* [#362][362] - Made API data objects immutable
* [#349][349] - Support application level configuration in fluo.properties
* [#342][342] - Add a configurable retry timeout to Fluo clients
* [#294][294] - Fluo now uses chroot suffix in its Zookeeper connection.
* [#293][293] - Add argument checking to FluoConfiguration
* [#244][244] - Make re-initialization easier for user
