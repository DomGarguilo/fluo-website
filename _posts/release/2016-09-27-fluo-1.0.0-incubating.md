Starting with 1.0.0-incubating, Apache Fluo will follow [semver](http://semver.org/) for all API
changes. The API consists of everything under the **org.apache.fluo.api** package. Code outside of this
package can change at any time. If your project is using Fluo code that falls outside of the API,
then consider [initiating a discussion](/getinvolved/) about adding it to the API.
