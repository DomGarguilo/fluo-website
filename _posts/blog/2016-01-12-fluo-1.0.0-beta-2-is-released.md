The Fluo project is happy to announce the [1.0.0-beta-2] release of [Fluo].  This is the third 
release of Fluo.  View the [release notes][notes] for a list of changes.

Since the beta-1 release two new Fluo related projects were created that helped
shape the beta-2 release.  These projects are [Webindex][webindex] and
[Fluo Recipes][fluo-recipes].

Fluo recipes is a project where implementations of common Fluo application
development patterns can be hosted.  Its goal it to make dveloping Fluo
applications easier, while leveraging the powerful primitive
operations that Fluo provides.  Creating Fluo Recipes highlighted the need for
some new APIs and functionality in Fluo.  A beta-1 release of Fluo Recipes was
just made and is now available in maven central.

Attempting to achieve the following goals with Webindex,  drove the development
of Fluo beta-2 and Fluo Recipes beta-1.

 * Operate on real data at scale
 * Integrate with Spark
 * Build a complex index used by a web application
