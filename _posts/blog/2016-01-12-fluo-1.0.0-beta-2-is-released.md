The Fluo project is happy to announce the [1.0.0-beta-2] release of [Fluo].  This is the third 
release of Fluo.  View the [release notes][notes] for a list of changes. For this release, a 
long run of the [Webindex][webindex] application was performed and is documented in 
[a blog post][webindex-post].

While there are no known issues that prevent production use, this release has not been tested
enough in a production environment to recommend it for production use.  However, this release
is a good entry point for starting to use Fluo as the API is mostly stable and a production
ready release is expected in 2016.

[Documentation][docs] and [javadocs][jdocs] are available.  The Fluo [jars][jars] have been
deployed to Maven Central.
